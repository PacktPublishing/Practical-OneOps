Couchbase Recipe, http://www.couchbase.org/

Couchbase is a distributed key-value database management system, optimized for storing data behind interactive web applications. 
Couchbase automatically spreads data and I/O across servers. This "scale out" approach at the data layer permits virtually unlimited growth of transaction capacity, with linear increases in cost and constant per-operation performance.
