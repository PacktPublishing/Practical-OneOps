It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Walmartâ€™s OneOps is an open source DevOps platform that is used for cloud and application lifecycle management. It can manage critical and complex application workload on any multi cloud-based infrastructure and revolutionizes the way administrators, developers, and engineers develop and launch new products.

This practical book focuses on real-life cases and hands-on scenarios to develop, launch, and test your applications faster, so you can implement the DevOps process using OneOps.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter09 only contains code.

The code will look like the following:
```
monitors => {  
     'Log' => {:description => 'Log',
          :source => '',
            :chart => {'min' => 0, 'unit' => ''},
```

This book assumes you have basic knowledge of Linux Operating System. It also assumes you have basic knowledge of DevOps practices. This book will go from basic setup to advanced setup of OneOps and its related functions.
